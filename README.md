# NuclearRestorer
A discord bot which can remove damage caused by nukes/raids and protect you from channel spamming. The bot provides you with tools to fix your server in case anything happens such as:
> Deleting all messages that have a certain keyphrase in them  
> Deleting all channels that have a certain keyphrase in their name  
> Bombing the server by deleting all channels (except for channels with a certain keyphrase in their name)  

Suspected nukers are also kicked (if possible) and a message is sent to the server owner (or the server's default channel if the server owner's DMs are off) with details about the nuke channel, the person who made the channel and the actions automatically taken by the bot.
