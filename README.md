# NuclearRestorer
A bot that:
- protects you from raids and nukes
- helps you mass delete channels
- helps you mass delete messages

### Nuke Protection
NuclearRestorer helps protect you from nukes by alerting the server owner (or the default channel if they're unavailable) when a spam channel is made, who made it and what the channel name was. It also deletes the channel and attempts to kick the user if possible with the permissions that the bot has.
